This project aims to predict the likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD) within ten years for patients based on various health indicators. It utilizes logistic regression for classification, with preprocessing steps including data normalization and splitting the dataset for training and testing. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, Jaccard similarity score, and a confusion matrix are employed to assess model performance.
